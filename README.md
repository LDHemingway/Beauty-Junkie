# Beauty Junkie #

## About ##
For my first React project, I created an app where I can list my favorite makeup products to share with those looking to find great makeup. I needed to make one model full crud, and the other have just add and delete. I plan on using this for personal use in the future to share with those curious about getting into makeup. I will make a branch where I can take out the add, edit, and delete functions for the users and have so I can only update it.

## Technologies ##
* React
* Express
* Node
* Ajax
* Axios
* Material U-I

## Stretch Goals ##
I would like to add a "Shop the Look" section where I include images of makeup looks I've done and the products used for those looks. I want to add a collapsible feature for each of the products to give the site a cleaner look as well.
